# duels-analyzer

I created this tool to help you visualise your ranked Duels statistics of Geoguessr.

Us it online at https://duels-analyzer.streamlit.app/


I am aware of the issue that it doesn't work a lot of times. Try going incognito.

Alternatively you can run it in your local, it works perfectly fine there. For that:

Clon the repo/ download the code

Open the command prompt and do

`pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies

Then do `streamlit run main.py`
